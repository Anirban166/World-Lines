## Abstract
This mini-project revolves around [Steins;Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate_(TV_series)), a sci-fi anime series that employs the hypothetical [black-hole theory](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Time-travel_theories#Black_hole_theory) for time travel, with a setup built around the existence of different world lines.

## Theory
To elucidate more precisely, time here is comprised of infinite parallel lines called '**World Lines**', which are mutable in nature. These lines can branch off (just like in Git/hierarchial stuff) at divergence points created by an event significant enough to create a seperation. <br>
For instance, assume that a person died in the current timeline and in response to that you travel back in time to prevent his/her death. This action would create a divergence in the past from the time point of the person's death, resulting in two divergent world lines - one with the person's existence, and one without. The idea prevails for similar actions, wherein such changes induce the creation of multiple world lines. 

Note that such events that trigger the splitting of world lines can be of lesser magnitude in effect than the aforementioned case (based on the existence of a person, which is a strong example), such as simply from a point where someone didn't buy a winning-lottery ticket to one where he/she did. (which is the example used to illustrate the Butterfly effect)
